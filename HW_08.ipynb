    "    For an input ${\\bf x}$, the output of the first layer of the network\n",

    "    second layer is $$h = \\langle {\\bf w}_2, {\\bf v} \\rangle + b_2 ~.$$\n",

    "    function with other activation functions, such as ReLU. (You can\n",
    "    explore other activation functions for extra credit.)\n",

    "### **Training Neural Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of training a neural network is to find a set of\n",
    "weights and biases that minimize the loss of our network, which in this\n",
    "case, is L2 loss. If these weights are all initialized to the same\n",
    "constant value, then they will all learn the same features. To avoid\n",
    "this, be sure that your implementation randomly initializes the weights.\n",
    "Numpy functions such as `np.random.normal` or `np.random.uniform` may be\n",
    "useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When training the two layer neural network, first calculate the\n",
    "gradients of the weights and biases for both layers before updating\n",
    "them. In the stencil, we have given you four methods for computing\n",
    "gradients: `_layer1_weights_gradient`, `_layer1_bias_gradient`,\n",
    "`_layer2_weights_gradient`, and `_layer2_bias_gradient`. Each of these\n",
    "methods should be called before performing gradient descent, i.e. before\n",
    "updating all of the gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also expect that you implement backpropagation as outlined in lecture\n",
    "i.e. computing all the outputs in the forward pass and saving them for\n",
    "use in the backward pass so that backpropagation achieves O(E)\n",
    "complexity, where E represents the number of edges in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Computing Gradients**\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to Lecture 17, slide 34 (Backpropagation) for the\n",
    "definition of the gradient computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are the activation functions at\n",
    "each layer, and not necessarily the same! Keep in mind that in your\n",
    "implementation for this assignment there should be no activation applied\n",
    "to the output layer of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that the initial input matrix is comprised of rows, but\n",
    "the input to each gradient function is a vector. This is due to\n",
    "contradicting conventions about how to represent training data and\n",
    "neural network inputs. To resolve this, you may choose to reshape or\n",
    "transpose the input matrix somewhere in the train method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** External libraries that make the implementation\n",
    "trivial are prohibited. Specifically, `numpy.linalg.lstsqnp` (and\n",
    "similar functions) cannot be used in your implementation. Additionally,\n",
    "you **cannot** use Tensorflow or other neural network libraries. You\n",
    "should implement the neural networks using only Python and Numpy."

    "When comparing the two models, the two-layer neural network performs slightly better than the one-layer model. Its average loss is lower on both the training set and the testing set. This happens because the two-layer network has a hidden layer, which gives it more flexibility and allows it to capture patterns that aren’t purely linear. In other words, the data likely contains some nonlinear structure, and the extra layer helps the model represent it more effectively. Also, the gap between training and testing loss is similar for both models, which means the two-layer network does not appear to be overfitting. Instead, it learns a slightly better representation of the data while still generalizing well to unseen examples."

    "The learning rate controls how large a step the model takes when updating its weights during training. A higher learning rate makes training faster but less stable, while a lower learning rate produces slower but more controlled updates.\n",
    "In the code, the one-layer network uses a learning rate of 0.001 and the two-layer network uses 0.01. Both values are small enough to keep training stable, and the slightly larger rate for the two-layer model helps it learn efficiently despite having more parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layer size determines how many units the network has to capture nonlinear relationships in the data. A larger hidden layer increases model capacity, while a smaller one keeps the network simpler and reduces the risk of overfitting. In the code, the two-layer model uses 10 hidden units. This gives the network enough flexibility to learn nonlinear structure in the wine dataset without making the model unnecessarily large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of epochs specifies how many full passes the model makes over the training data. More epochs allow the model to refine its weights, but too many can lead to overfitting, especially on small datasets. In the code, both models run for 25 epochs, which is enough for the loss to decrease and stabilize without showing obvious signs of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The batch size defines how many samples are used to compute each gradient update. A batch size of 1 corresponds to stochastic gradient descent, where the model updates after every example. This adds noise to the updates but often helps avoid poor local minima. In the code, both networks use a batch size of 1. This fits the small wine dataset and allows frequent updates without the overhead of computing gradients on larger batches."

    "\n",
    "1. When a 'black-box' model gives an answer that disagrees with a human expert, there isn’t a single rule that always tells us who is right. The better choice depends on the situation. In high-risk areas—such as medicine, law, or finance—we usually have stronger reasons to trust the expert. These fields rely heavily on domain knowledge, causal understanding, and real-world experience, which machine learning models may not fully capture. Models can also make mistakes when the input data is very different from their training data. On the other hand, there are cases where the model may deserve more weight. When the problem involves large amounts of data or subtle patterns that humans cannot easily detect—such as image recognition or large-scale predictions—well-validated models can outperform experts. If the model has been tested rigorously, shows consistent accuracy, and operates within the same type of data it was trained on, its predictions can sometimes be more reliable than human judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is an important difference between traditional closed-source software and black-box AI systems. With closed-source software, the logic is hidden from users, but it still exists in a clear, human-written form. Developers know exactly how each part of the system works, and in principle, the rules can be reviewed, audited, or explained if access is granted. Black-box AI models are different. Even the creators may not fully understand how the model arrives at specific decisions because the internal patterns are learned automatically from data, not designed by hand. This creates extra uncertainty: we may not know what features the model relies on, how it generalizes, or why it behaves unexpectedly in certain cases. Because of this, using closed-source software is usually easier to justify. Even though the code is hidden, there is still a clear and deterministic logic behind it. Black-box AI, on the other hand, may require additional safeguards, such as transparency reports, auditing, testing for bias, and human oversight, before it is used in important decisions."
